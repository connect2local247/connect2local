        At Connect2Local, we prioritize data security and implement robust measures to safeguard your sensitive information:<br><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px">User Side Security</b> <br><br>
        Two-Step Authentication: We provide users with the option to enable two-step authentication for added security.

        Secure Data Storage: Your data is stored securely in our database, utilizing advanced security protocols to prevent unauthorized access. In the unlikely event of a security breach, even if an attacker gains access to our database, they would only have access to basic data that does not personally identify you. Additionally, facial images are not stored by our system, as users have the choice to upload them to their profiles.<br><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px">Transaction Authorization</b> <br><br>
        We prioritize your consent for any transactions on our platform, especially concerning payment details. No transaction is executed in our system without your explicit authorization.
